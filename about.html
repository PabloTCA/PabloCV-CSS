        I am a human who loves technology, all my life has circle arround technology, sicnce I was a little kid full of joy, I always have been close with
        tech, that includes computers, video games, streaming, editing. I remember when I came back from school, turning on the computer and playing flash games
        on the PC, I was so happy but at the same time curious about how it works, so I started to learn it. 
        I have a good skill to learn things, I am a fast learnet.
